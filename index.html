      When artist Colette Crutcher submitted her proposal to mosaic a staircase, she never imagined that her artwork would become
       one of San Francisco’s hidden gems. 
  
      <br>
      <br>
  
      The Moraga Steps in San Francisco’s Sunset district feature a tiled, ocean-themed, spiral design. Since its mosaicking in 2005, 
      the 163-step staircase has been a major attraction in the neighborhood, drawing in San Franciscans and tourists alike.
  
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      The Moraga Steps staircase was one of the first in San Francisco to gain new life through mosaic art. But stairs are a common 
      feature in the city because of its many hills and slopes. Since 2005, more staircases have become public artworks, bringing 
      communities together and beautifying neighborhoods. Alexandra Kenin, a San Francisco resident and hiking enthusiast, said these
       staircases are “living, breathing connectors for San Francisco.”

    <h3>Commission process</h3>
    
    <p class = "body">
    
    Decorating staircases and other public spaces starts with a lengthy commissioning process.
    <br>
    <br>
    
    According to the San Francisco Arts Commission, the city must approve the temporary or permanent installation
     of art on any city property. San Francisco allocates a small amount of funding to public art and welcomes artists
      to submit proposals to receive funding. From there, three artists are selected as finalists by a committee to
      execute their ideas before one is ultimately chosen. 
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Some artists, such as Crutcher and artist collaborator Aileen Barr, try to fundraise from the community for their projects 
    instead of waiting for funding from the city. Artists bring these projects into reality by turning to donors in their communities.
     In return, donors have their names featured in the art pieces.
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Although public art projects are generally not well-funded and take a long time to come to fruition, Crutcher and Barr are lucky 
    enough to have become well-known for their mosaic staircase work. People reach out to them for independent projects, which means
     they are able to execute projects more freely. Barr said when she was working on the Lincoln Park staircase, the private school 
     that reached out gave her “full artistic freedom” and “didn’t really voice any opinions.” 
    
    </p>



    <h3>From 2D to 3D </h3>

    <div class="photos">
      <img src="A1.jpg" style="height:200px">

    </div>
    
    <p class = "body">
      Even after a public artwork has been commissioned, it may take years to complete. Crutcher and Barr, who met through the Moraga Steps 
      project, took months to transform a blank piece of paper into the staircase that the neighborhood knows today. 
    <br>
    <br>
    In the initial phase of the project proposal, Crutcher and Barr separately supplied draft designs to the commissioners. The organizers 
    liked both of the artists' designs and styles and asked them if they wanted to collaborate on this project. 
    <br>
    <br>
    
    But not every project proposal turns into a successful collaboration. Sometimes, Barr said, “you end up doing a lot of work in creating 
    a concept and a design,” and it is not guaranteed that it will be chosen.
  
    <br>
    <br>
    
    “It's a hard process as you're shortlisted with a couple other artists,” she said. Depending on the project type, artists of all mediums have a chance to propose a design.
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Crutcher said the most difficult aspect of designing a mosaic staircase is perspective. A staircase can be as narrow as 6 feet or as wide as 30 feet, depending on the 
    location. Similarly, the staircase could be long or short.
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>

    <blockquote class="quote"> “It is a challenge to design a staircase, especially these staircases when they’re narrow and really long,” Barr said. “Coming up with a design that suits that, and [how] your
     design has to be cut up into strips. And it moves back in space.”
    </blockquote>
     
  
    <p class="body">
    
      <br>   
     Once the final design is selected, the artists create a life-sized sketch. Crutcher recalled how she and Barr viewed the design in her basement studio from a floor above to see 
     the entire piece as they were creating the tiles for Moraga Steps. 
    <br>
    <br>
    
    “We did have to draw it actual size with a big roll of paper. We were doing it [in my studio] where there wasn’t enough rooms. So we roll it out on the floor and then draw a little 
    bit and then one of us would climb up the stairs and look down,” she said.
    <br>
    <br>
    
    In the next steps, the artists work hands on with ceramics and/or tiles. Barr considers this part her favorite in the entire process. 
   
    <br>
    </p>

    <div class="photos">
      <img src="C1.jpg" style="height:200px">
      <img src="C2.jpg" style="height:200px">
      <img src="C3.jpg" style="height:200px">
      <img src="C5.jpg" style="height:200px">

    </div>

    <p class="body">
    <br>
    
    “Once I have my design done and I know what I am doing and I start making stuff, that’s the part I like, when I get my hands get dirty,” she said. Throughout their first project together, Barr 
    taught Crutcher the ins and outs of ceramic tile making, from rolling out the clay to shaping it into design pieces.
    <br>
    <br>
    
    The glazing of the tiles follows, and Barr has a large collection to choose from as well as plenty of test pieces to show her clients. Glazing the tiles and allowing them to dry before 
    putting them in the kiln is a critical step in the process. Barr's studio space has a ready-to-use kiln that can hold a large number of tiles at once – important for projects like the Moraga steps
     project which has over 2,000 handmade tiles. When Barr and Crutcher collaborate on a project, the ceramic work is usually done in Barr's studio.
  
    <br>
    <br>
    
    The artists' final step is to lay out and glue all of the tiles on a plastic mesh for installation, which is done by a separate company. While the art is being installed, the artists go to supervise
     and assist with placement, as well as if something happens to a tile.
     <br>
     <br>
    
     Though the process is lengthy, the artists find satisfaction in being able to show their work in a meaningful way. 
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>

    <blockquote class="quote">
    “Public art does pay something at least so it's a way to make a living and to get your artwork seen by people, which is exciting,”
     Crutcher said. “Makes you feel like you're part of a community which is what's been seen by.”
    </blockquote>

    
    <h3>Building up the Community</h3>

    <div class="photos">
      <img src="HS3.jpg" style="height:200px">
      <img src="HS5.jpg" style="height:200px">
      <img src="HS6.jpg" style="height:200px">
      <img src="HS7.jpg" style="height:200px">

    </div>
    
    <p class = "body">
    Even after a staircase is installed, the upward climb continues. One of the intriguing parts about public work like staircases is the role the people play in the art 
    itself. The staircases designed by Barr, Crutcher, and other artists have left immeasurable impacts on the community. 
    <br>
    <br>
    
    One of these impacts has been bringing people together across San Francisco. Alexandra Kenin, who documented over 900 staircases around the city, said “occasionally, 
    you’ll meet someone really cool on a stairway.”  She said she met a man in his 90s named Rudy who encouraged her to keep climbing up the steep staircase.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    While some staircase art installations were commissioned by the city, others, like the Lincoln Park Steps, were funded entirely by neighboring residents. The Lincoln 
    Park Steps staircase, built in the early 1900s, was falling apart and being graffitied over, so the project, according to Barr, was an opportunity to make the city look nice again.
    <br>
    <br>
    Other staircase projects sought to improve the aesthetic of certain San Francisco neighborhoods in different ways. According to Crutcher, the Moraga Steps were inspired by a woman who
     moved to a particularly gray and foggy part of San Francisco after living in Rio de Janeiro. Missing all the colorfulness of Rio, she began organizing a project to decorate the steps.
      Barr and Crutcher worked together to design mosaic tiles, and the steps became a tourist attraction and a brightening addition to the area.
    <br>
    <br>
    The Hidden Garden staircase, which is just a few blocks from the 16th Avenue and Moraga staircase, also brightened up a dark area. Barr said because the staircase was dark and hidden, 
    “people didn’t want to use it in the evening coming off the train, so they wanted to create something much brighter and more inviting.”
  
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Staircases around San Francisco have brightened the city, but it is also the community’s responsibility to participate in the upkeep of these works of art. Paul Signorelli, one of the
     key leaders of the Hidden Garden staircase project, believes the community is the center of public art projects. 
  
     
    <br>
    <br>
    “It’s building communities that suddenly have the opportunity to bring two disparate neighborhoods together.”
